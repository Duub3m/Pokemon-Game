Overview:
This is a personal fun project where I’ve recreated elements of a Pokémon game using JavaScript and HTML. I’ve utilized sprite files to render the visual components and used JavaScript to simulate animations, bringing the game world to life. This project is still in development as I work on it in my free time to enhance both the visuals and the gameplay.

Features:
Sprites for Imagery: Pokémon and environment graphics are brought to life using carefully selected sprite files.
JavaScript Animations: Dynamic animations such as character movements, battle effects, and environment interactions are simulated using JavaScript.
HTML Structure: The game is built using HTML as the foundation for displaying the canvas and other UI components.
Development Progress
Game Engine: A basic game engine is in place for rendering sprites and controlling animations.
Animations: Sprite animations for character movement and battles are implemented.
Interactivity: Ongoing development of interaction mechanics, including moving through maps and triggering battle scenes.

Future Plans:
Add more battle mechanics to simulate Pokémon attacks and health systems.
Expand the game world by adding new maps and environments.
Incorporate audio effects to enhance gameplay immersion.

Why I Made This:
I’ve always been a fan of Pokémon games, and this project is a way for me to combine my love for the franchise with my web development skills. It’s a great opportunity to experiment with sprite animations and game mechanics while having fun in the process.
